# base-web-project
Basic web project that will have different files to build off of.

HTML:
* index.html is a base HTML file that is minimum needed to run a styled web page with js code.

CSS:
* normalize.css is code from: https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/ to help show the code similarly in all browsers.
* style.css is the base css file that is for the main styles of the page.

JS:
* jquery-2.2.0.js is needed from: https://jquery.com/ to add jQuery functionality to the project.
* main.js is base code to use for basic Start() and Update() functions. Update() has deltaTime passed through.
* state_enum.js is base code to use for state mechanics made with enum and functions.
* state_obj.js is base code to use for state mechanics made with objects. (@chris_deleon's feedback)
* oops.js is base code for an object that shows construction and inheritance.
* class.js is base code for a class that shows construction and inheritance.
